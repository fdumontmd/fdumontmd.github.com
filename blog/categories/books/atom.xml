    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The exam exercises for this chapter were much trickier than the
homework exercises. With the right approach, they could be solved
quickly; too bad I never found that right approach...</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Exam Exercises</h2>

<h3>$\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^k\frac{k}{4k^2-1}$</h3>

<p>I managed to solve this exercise using sum by parts; the book uses
partial fractions, but as far as I can tell I never learned about
these. They seem to be part of high school curriculum in America, but
might not be in Belgium (or I was sleeping that day).</p>

<p>Sum by parts worked for me because I eventually asked myself what kind
of function of $k$ would produce a finite difference
$\frac{1}{4k^2-1} = \frac{1}{(2k+1)(2k-1)}$.</p>

<p>By looking at $\Delta (2k)^{\underline m}$, I realised that the
solution was fairly simple. I first experimented with
$\Delta (2k)^{\underline{-1}}$, then found the right expression:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\Delta (2k-2)^{\underline{-1}} &amp; = \frac{1}{2k+1}-\frac{1}{2k-1}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{2k-1 - 2k - 1}{(2k+1)(2k-1)}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{-2}{4k^2-1}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>For the sum by parts, I can therefore try to use:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\Delta v &amp; = \frac{1}{4k^2-1}\\\\
v &amp; = -\frac{1}{2}(2k-2)^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
Ev &amp; = -\frac{1}{2}(2k)^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
u &amp; = (-1)^kk\\\\
\Delta u &amp; = (-1)^k +(k+1)(-2 (-1)^k)\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^k - 2(k+1)(-1)^k\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^k(1-2k-2)\\\\
&amp; = -(-1)^k(2k+1)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The last expression was computed using the product rule for finite difference.</p>

<p>When I put everything into the sum by parts formula, the various
blocks felt into place with satisfying "clicks":</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum (-1)^x\frac{x}{4x^2-1}\delta x 
= &amp; -\frac{1}{2}(-1)^x x(2x-2)^{\underline{-1}} \\\\
&amp; - \frac{1}{2} \sum (-1)^x (2x+1)(2x)^{\underline{-1}}\delta x\\\\
= &amp; -\frac{(-1)^x x}{2(2x-1)} - \frac{1}{2}\sum (-1)^x \delta x
&amp;&amp;(2x+1)(2x)^{\underline{-1}}=1\\\\
= &amp; -\frac{(-1)^x x}{2(2x-1)} + \frac{(-1)^x}{4} + c\\\\
= &amp; (-1)^x \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{x}{2(2x-1)} \right) + c\\\\
= &amp; (-1)^x \left(\frac{4x - 2 - 4x}{4.2.(2x-1)} \right) + c\\\\
= &amp; -\frac{(-1)^x}{8x-4} + c\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The answer as a function of $n$ is</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k\frac{k}{4k^2-1} 
= &amp; \sum_1^{n+1} (-1)^x\frac{x}{4x^2-1}\delta x\\\\
= &amp; \left. -\frac{(-1)^x}{8x^4}\right|_1^{n+1}\\\\
= &amp; -\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{8n+8-4} - \frac{1}{4}\\\\
= &amp; \frac{(-1)^n}{8n+4} - \frac{1}{4}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>1050</h3>

<p>I could not do this exercise; I also failed to see the basic sum that
was at the centre of the question (quite prominently).</p>

<p>Even the book solution took me a while to figure out.</p>

<p>The book solution asks how many pairs $a$, $b$ are there such that
$\sum_{a\le k \lt b}k = 1050$.</p>

<p>Rewriting this in terms of finite calculus is simple enough:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{a\le k \lt b}k &amp; = \sum_a^b x\delta x\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(b^{\underline 2} - a^{\underline 2}\right)\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(b(b-1) - a(a-1)\right)\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(b^2-b - a^2 + a\right)\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(b^2-b + ab - a^2 + a - ab\right)\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(b(b-1+a) - a(a-1+b)\right)\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}(b-a)(b+a-1)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Now, one thing to notice is that if a sum of two integers is even, so is
the difference, and vice-versa. Therefore the product above is the
product of one even and one odd integers.</p>

<p>So we are now looking for ways to express</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
(b-a)(b+a-1)=xy=2.1050=2100=2^2 3 5^2 7\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>as a product with $x$ is even and $y$ odd.</p>

<p>To compute how many ways there are to produce a divisor of a number
whose prime factors are known, it is enough to see that, for each
prime factor $p$ with multiplicity $n_p$, this prime can be left out,
or included up to $n_p$ times in the divisor; so for each prime p
there are $n_p+1$ possibilities. Summing these over the prime factors
give the number of divisors of the original number.</p>

<p>In the present case, this number is 12.</p>

<p>Now that we have the number of possible pairs of $x$ and $y$, we have
to go back to $a$ and $b$.  There might be a principle involved here,
but I don't really see it, so I'll just try to rebuild the solution
from the ground up.</p>

<p>We already know that either
$b-a=x$ and $b+a-1=y$ or $b-a=y$ and $b+a-1=x$. So we already see that
whatever expression we need, both $a$ and $b$ will have a
$\frac{1}{2}$ added so that their difference cancels out, and their
sum produces a $1$ that will cancel the $-1$.</p>

<p>Looking at sum and differences, we have $(x+y)-(x-y) = 2y$ and
$(x+y)+(x-y)=2x$, so there will be a sum and a difference involved. We
also need $a$ to be smaller than $b$, so it is a candidate for
$\frac{1}{2}(x-y)+\frac{1}{2}$. However, we also need it to be
positive, so we add an absolute value.</p>

<p>So the candidate solutions are $a=\frac{1}{2}|x-y|+\frac{1}{2}$ and
$b=\frac{1}{2}(x+y)+\frac{1}{2}$. Let's check them:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
x \gt y: &amp; 
(\frac{1}{2}(x+y)+\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}(x-y)-\frac{1}{2})
(\frac{1}{2}(x+y)+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(x-y)+\frac{1}{2} - 1)\\\\
= &amp; (\frac{1}{2}(2y))(\frac{1}{2}(2x))\\\\
= &amp; yx\\\\
x \lt y: &amp;
(\frac{1}{2}(x+y)+\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}(y-x)-\frac{1}{2})
(\frac{1}{2}(x+y)+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(y-x)+\frac{1}{2} - 1)\\\\
= &amp; (\frac{1}{2}(2x))(\frac{1}{2}(2y))\\\\
= &amp; xy\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>So it all adds up.</p>

<h3>Riemann's zeta function</h3>

<p>This exercise was more in line with the content of this chapter, and
easy enough. Essentially, it is just a matter of changing the order of
summation.</p>

<h4>$\sum_{k\ge 2}(\zeta(k)-1) = 1$</h4>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\ge 2}(\zeta(k)-1) 
&amp; = \sum_{k\ge 2}(\sum_{j\ge 1}\frac{1}{j^k}-1)\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k\ge 2}(\sum_{j\ge 2}\frac{1}{j^k})\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{j\ge 2}\sum_{k\ge 2}\frac{1}{j^k}\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{j\ge 2}\sum_{k\ge 2}(\frac{1}{j})^k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The inner sum is a geometric progression:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\ge 2}(\frac{1}{j})^k 
&amp; = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}
\frac{\frac{1}{j^2}-\frac{1}{j^n}}{1-\frac{1}{j}}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{\frac{1}{j^2}-0}{1-\frac{1}{j}}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{j(j-1)}
\end{align}
</div>


<p>So we need to solve
$\sum_{j\ge 2}\frac{1}{j(j-1)}=\sum_{j\ge 0}\frac{1}{(j+1)(j+2)}$,
which we already saw as well, and the value is indeed 1.</p>

<h4>$\sum_{k\ge 1}(\zeta(2k)-1)$</h4>

<p>Using the same approach:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\ge 1}(\zeta(2k)-1) &amp; = \sum_{k\ge 1} 
(\sum_{j\ge 1}\frac{1}{j^{2k}}-1)\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k\ge 1}\sum_{j\ge 2}\frac{1}{j^{2k}}\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{j\ge 2}\sum_{k\ge 1}\frac{1}{j^{2k}}\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{j\ge 2}\sum_{k\ge 1}(\frac{1}{j^2})^k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Once again, we have a geometric progression, just as easy to solve as
the previous one:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\ge 1}(\frac{1}{j^2})^k 
&amp; = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}
\frac{\frac{1}{j^2}-\frac{1}{j^{2n}}}{1-\frac{1}{j^2}}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{\frac{1}{j^2}-0}{1-\frac{1}{j^2}}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{j^2-1}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{(j11)(j+1)}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{j}{(j-1)j(j+1)}\\\\
&amp; = j (j-2)^{\underline{-3}}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Now we have $\sum_{j\ge 2} j(j-2)^{\underline{-3}}$, which can be
summed by parts. I chose:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\Delta v &amp; = (x-2)^{\underline{-3}}\\\\
v &amp; = -\frac{(x-2)^{\underline{-2}}}{2}\\\\
Ev &amp; = -\frac{(x-1)^{\underline{-2}}}{2}\\\\
u &amp; = x\\\\
\Delta u &amp; = 1\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>and now the sum by part:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_2^{\infty} x(x-2)^{\underline{-3}}\delta x
&amp; = -\frac{x}{(x-1)x} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_2^\infty
(x-1)^{\underline{-2}}\delta x\\\\
&amp; = \left. -\frac{1}{2(x-1)}-\frac{1}{2x}\right|_2^\infty\\\\
&amp; = \frac{3}{4}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>$\sum_{k\ge 0}\min(k, x \dot{-} k)$</h3>

<p>I am not really sure of my solution here, despite the fact that the
outcome is identical to the book; my method is somewhat different from
the book's, and using some concepts from Chapter 3.</p>

<p>To prove that the two sums have the same value, I just evaluate each.</p>

<p>First, a basic observation on the $\dot{-}$ operator: if
$b\le 0$, $a\dot{-}b$ is at least zero, and if $a\le 0$, at most
$a$ (otherwise it is always zero).</p>

<p>So if $a\le 0$ or $a\le b$, $a\dot{-}b=0$.</p>

<p>I will now assume that $x\ge 0$; otherwise both sums are zero.</p>

<h3>$\sum_{k\ge 0}\min(k,x\dot{-}k)$</h3>

<p>First, I replace the infinity sum by a finite one: as seen above, if
$k\gt x$, $\min(k,x\dot{-}k)=0$, so</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\ge 0}\min(k,x\dot{-}k) &amp; = \sum_{0\le k \le x}\min(k,x-k)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>I then try to remove the $\min$ operator:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
k &amp; \le x - k\\\\
2k &amp; \le x\\\\
k &amp; \le \frac{x}{2}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>so that</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{0\le k \le x}\min(k,x-k)
&amp; = \sum_{0\le k \le \frac{x}{2}} k
&amp; + \sum_{\frac{x}{2}\lt k \le x} x - k
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The general idea here is to find a way to eliminate the $k$ terms, by
shifting each term in the second sum by an equal amount.</p>

<p>At this point, the number of terms in each sum is important: the total
number of terms is the number of $k$ such that $0\le k\le x$; clearly
this is $\lfloor x \rfloor + 1$.</p>

<p>The number of terms in the first sum is similarly
$\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor + 1$.</p>

<p>The number of terms in the second sum is therefore
$\lfloor x \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$. To find an
expression for this, it helps to look at integral $x$ first.</p>

<p>If $x=4$, $\lfloor 4 \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{4}{2} \rfloor = 2$.</p>

<p>If $x=5$, $\lfloor 5 \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{5}{2} \rfloor = 5-2 = 3$.</p>

<p>More generally, if $2n\le \lt 2n+1$, there will be $n+1$ terms in the
first sum, and $n$ in the second. And if $2n-1\le x\le 2n$, there will
be $n$ terms in each sum.</p>

<p>A first attempt for the number of terms in the second sum is
$\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$, but this only works for $x$ such that
$2n\le x\lt 2n+1$. But it is easy to see that
$\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2} \rfloor$ will always work: if
$2n\le x\lt 2n+1$,
$\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor\frac{2n+1}{2}\rfloor = n$,
and if $2n-1\le x\lt 2n$,
$\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor = \lfloor\frac{2n}{2}\rfloor = n$.</p>

<p>Using this value to "shift" the terms of the second sum:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{0\le k \le \frac{x}{2}} k
+ \sum_{\frac{x}{2}\lt k \le x} x - k
&amp; = \sum_{0\le k \le \frac{x}{2}} k
+ \sum_{\frac{x}{2}-\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor\lt k\le x- \lfloor
\frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor}
(x-\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor)-k\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{0\le k \le \lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor} k
+ \sum_{\frac{x}{2}-\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor\lt k\le \lfloor
\frac{x}{2}\rfloor}
(x-\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor)-k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Now the question is whether the new $k$ in the second sum cancel the
$k$ in the first sum. Once again, let's check the cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>if $2n\le x\lt 2n+1$,
$\frac{x}{2} \gt \lfloor\frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor$, so $k\ge 1$: this
means the $\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor$ non-zero $k$ terms of the
first sum are cancelled by the
$\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor = \lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor$ non zero
$k$ terms of the second sum; the zero term can safely be ignored.</li>
<li>if $2n-1\le x\lt 2n$,
$\frac{x}{2} \lt \lfloor\frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor$, so $k\ge 0$; this
means the $\lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+1$ $k$ terms (including 0) are
all cancelled by the
$\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor = \lfloor \frac{x}{2}\rfloor+1$ $k$
terms of the second sum.</li>
</ul>


<p>So we can safely rewrite the sum as</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{\frac{x}{2} - \lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor \lt k \le 
\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor}(x-\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>And, as we already know the number of terms is
$\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor$, the sum value is</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor
\left(x- \left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor\right)
\end{align}
</div>


<h4>$\sum_{k\le 0}(x\dot{-}(2k+1))$</h4>

<p>This sum is much easier than the previous one. First I remove the
$\dot{-}$ operator. I need $2k+1\le x$:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
2k+1 &amp; \le x\\\\
k &amp; \le \frac{x-1}{2}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>This gives me $\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor$ number of terms.</p>

<p>So I can extract $x$ and work only on $k$</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor(x-1) +
2 \sum_{0\le k\lt \lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\rfloor}k 
&amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor(x-1)+
\left\lfloor\frac{x-1}{2}\right\rfloor\left\lfloor\frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor\\\\
&amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor
(x - 1 - \left\lfloor \frac{x-1}{2}\right\rfloor)\\\\
&amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor
(x - \left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>So the both expressions have the same value.</p>

<h2>Bonus Questions</h2>

<h3>$\vee$ Laws</h3>

<p>I find it easier to work from the basic $\min$ operator, and scale
that up to $\vee$ (the formulas can always be derived mechanically
from the underlying algebra).</p>

<p>$\min$ is an associative and commutative operator, is distributive
with addition, and its neutral element is $\infty$.</p>

<p>I will not repeat the full list of formulas; the book has them
already.</p>

<h3>Undefined infinite sums</h3>

<p>An undefined sum, according to (2.59), is one in which both the
positive sum and the negative sums are unbounded.</p>

<p>I define $K^+$ as $\{k\in K| a_k \gt 0\}$ and $K^-$ as
$\{k\in K| a_k\lt 0\}$.</p>

<p>The point about unbounded sums is that, even if I drop a large number
of terms, there are always enough remaining terms to add up to an
arbitrary amount.</p>

<p>For instance, given $n$ even and $E_n=K^+\setminus F_{n-1}$,
it is always true that I can find $E'_n\subset E_n$ such that</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\in E'_n}a_k \ge A^+ - \sum_{k\in F_{n-1}}a_k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>So if I define $F_n = F_{n-1} \cup E'_n$, $\sum_{k\in F_n}a_k \ge A^+$.</p>

<p>And when $n$ is odd, with $O_n=K^-\setminus F_{n-1}$, I can always
find a subset $O'_n\subset O_n$ such that</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\in O'_n}a_k \le A^- - \sum_{k\in F_{n-1}}a_k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>(with $K^-$, the $a_k$ are smaller than zero, so the sum can be
arbitrarily small).</p>

<p>If I define $F_n = F_{n-1} \cup O'_n$, $\sum_{k\in F_n}a_k \le A^-$.</p>

<p>As I could not do the other bonus questions, this completes Chapter 2.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a long time since I wrote about this book; I had worked
the solutions more than a month ago, but then life happened, and I
could not find the time (or, perhaps, more accurately the courage) to
typeset my notes...</p>

<p>Anyway, I do have time now and am eager to go on with Chapter 3; but
first let's finish Chapter 2. Today the homework exercises, and very
soon the exams and bonus (at least the ones I could do) exercises.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Homework</h2>

<h3>$2T_n = nT_{n-1}+3\cdot n!$</h3>

<p>This exercise is not tricky in any way; just follow the method and
the result is guaranteed.</p>

<p>The recurrence equations are</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
T_0 &amp; = 5\\\\
2T_n &amp; = nT_{n-1}+3\cdot n!\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The $a_n$, $b_n$ and $c_n$ series are:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
a_n &amp; = 2\\\\
b_n &amp; = n\\\\
c_n &amp; = 3\cdot n!\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The summation factor</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
s_n &amp; = \frac{a_{n-1}\dots a_1}{b_n\dots b_2}s_1\\\\
&amp; = \frac{2^{n-1}}{n!}s_1\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>After experimenting a bit, I found that $s_1 = 2$ is slightly easier
to work with, so the summation factor is $s_n = \frac{2^n}{n!}$.</p>

<p>With $S_n = \frac{2^n+1}{n!} T_n$, the recurrence equation becomes</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
S_n &amp; = S_{n-1} + 3\cdot 2^n\\\\
&amp; = S_0 + 3\sum_{k=1}^n 2^k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The sum is well-known, with $\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1}-1$, so
$\sum_{k=1}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1}-2$.</p>

<p>Going back to $T_n$, we have</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
T_n &amp; = \frac{n!(10+3(2^{n+1}-2))}{2^{n+1}}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{n!(5+3(2^n-1))}{2^n}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{n!(5 + 3\cdot 2^n - 3)}{2^n}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{n!(3\cdot 2^n + 2)}{2^n}\\\\
&amp; = 3\cdot n! + \frac{n!}{2^{n-1}}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>$\sum_{k=0}^n kH_k$</h3>

<p>Using the perturbation method:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
S_{n+1} = S_n + (n+1) H_{n+1} &amp; = 0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k H_k\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k+1=1}^{n+1}(k+1)H_{k+1}&amp;&amp;k\leftarrow k+1\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n (k+1) (H_k + \frac{1}{k+1})\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n k H_k + \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{k}{k+1} 
+ \sum_{k=0}^n H_k + \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k+1}\\\\
&amp; = S_n + \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{k+1}{k+1} + \sum_{k_0}^n H_k\\\\
&amp; = S_n + n+1 + \sum_{k=0}^n H_k\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>so $\sum_{k=0}^n H_k$ is</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^n H_k &amp; = (n+1)H_{n+1} - (n + 1)\\\\
&amp; = (n+1)H_n + (n+1)\frac{1}{n+1} - n - 1\\\\
&amp; = (n+1)H_n + 1 - n - 1\\\\
&amp; = (n+1)H_n - n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>More perturbation method</h3>

<p>This exercise is just tricky in the very first step (working out the
exact meaning of $S_{n+1}$), as the sign of the terms change depending
of whether $n$ is odd or even.</p>

<p>This means that instead of the book equation (2.24)
$S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}$, we find something like
$S_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - S_n$.</p>

<h4>$S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n-k}$</h4>

<p>First, the left hand part of the equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
S_{n+1} &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n+1-k} + (-1)^{n+1-n-1}\\\\
&amp; = -\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n-k} + 1\\\\
&amp; = 1 - S_n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Then, the right hand part:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
S_{n+1} &amp; = (-1)^{n+1} + \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} (-1)^{n+1-k}\\\\
&amp; =
(-1)^{n+1}+\sum_{k+1=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k-1}&amp;&amp;k\leftarrow k+1\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^{n+1} + \sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^{n+1} + S_n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Putting both together, $S_n = \frac{1-(-1)^{n+1}}{2}$, or, as the book
states, $S_n = [\text{\(n\) is even}]$.</p>

<h4>$T_n = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n-k}k$</h4>

<p>Using the same approach as above:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
T_{n+1} &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k}k\\\\
&amp; = -\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}k + (-1){n+1-n-1}(n+1)\\\\
&amp; = n+1-T_n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>and</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
T_{n+1} &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k}k\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^{n+1}0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k}k\\\\
&amp; = 0 + \sum_{k+1=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k-1}{k+1}&amp;&amp;k\leftarrow k+1\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}k + \sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}\\\\
&amp; = T_n + S_n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Together:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
T_n &amp; = \frac{n+1-S_n}{2}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(n+[\text{\(n\) is odd}] \right)\\\\
&amp; = \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The last version uses the ceiling operator from Chapter 3.</p>

<h4>$U_n = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n-k}k^2$</h4>

<p>It will probably not be a surprised to find $U_n$ expressed in terms
of $S_n$ and $T_n$.</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
U_{n+1} &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k}k^2\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n+1-k}k^2 + (-1)^{n+1-n-1}(n+1)^2\\\\
&amp; = -1\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}k^2 + (n+1)^2\\\\
&amp; = (n+1)^2 - U_n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>and</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
U_{n+1} &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k}k^2\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^{n+1}0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k}k^2\\\\
&amp; = 0 + \sum_{k+1=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k-2}(k+1)^2&amp;&amp;
k\leftarrow k+1\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}(k^2+2k+1)\\\\
&amp; = U_n + 2T_n + S_n\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>With $2T_n = n+1-S_n$, this produces $U_{n+1} = U_n + n + 1$, which
gives the answer away, but let's just continue with the current
method.</p>

<p>Putting both side together:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
U_n &amp = \frac{(n+1)^2 - (n+1)}{2}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{(n+1)(n+1) - (n+1)}{2}\\\\
&amp; = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>Lagrange's Identity</h3>

<p>First, I look for a usable double sum. I use the fact that for any
$j, k$, $j &lt; k$, $(a_jb_k - a_kb_j) = -(a_kb_j - a_jb_k)$ and
$(A_jB_k - A_kB_j)= - (A_kB_j - A_jB_k)$. This means that, with
$s_{j,k} = (a_jb_k - a_kb_j)(A_jB_k - A_kB_j)$, $s_{j,k} = s_{k,j}$.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that $s_{j,j} = 0$, so now I can complete the
sum to the whole rectangle:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{1\le j,k\le n}s_{j,k} &amp; = \sum_{1\le j\lt k\le n}s_{j,k}
+ \sum_{1\le j = k \le n} s_{j,k} + \sum_{1\le k \lt j \le
n}s_{k,j}\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{1\le j \lt k \le n}s_{j,k} + 0
+ \sum_{1\le j \lt k \le n}s_{j,k}\\\\
&amp; = 2\sum_{1\le j \lt k \le n}s_{j,k}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The expansion of $s_{j,k}$ is
$a_jA_jb_kB_k - a_jB_jA_kb_k - A_jb_ja_kB_k + b_jB_ja_kA_k$. Showing
the summation just for the first one (the other three are identical):</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{1\le j, k \le n} a_jA_jb_kB_k &amp; = \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n a_jA_jb_kB_k\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{j=1}^n a_jA_j \left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_kB_k \right)\\\\
&amp; = \left(\sum_{j=1}^n a_jA_j\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_kB_k \right)\\\\
&amp; = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_kA_k\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_kB_k \right)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{1\le j\lt k\le n}(a_jb_k - a_kb_j)(A_jB_k - A_kB_j) &amp; =
\left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_kA_k\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_kB_k\right) -
\left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_kB_k\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^n A_kb_k\right)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>In particular, with $a_k = A_k$ and $b_k = B_k$, the sum is
$\left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) - 2 \left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_k \right)$.</p>

<h3>$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2k+1}{k(k+1)}$</h3>

<h4>Partial fractions</h4>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{2k+1}{k(k+1)}
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n(k+(k+1))\left(\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1} \right)\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k}{k} + \frac{k+1}{k} - \frac{k}{k+1} - \frac{k+1}{k+1} \right)\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k+1}{k} - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k}{k+1}\\\\
&amp; = n + H_n - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k}{k+1} -
\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k+1} + \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k+1}\\\\
&amp; = n + H_n - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k+1}{k+1} + \sum_{k=1}^n
\frac{1}{k+1}\\\\
&amp; = H_n + \sum_{k-1=1}^n \frac{1}{k}&amp;&amp;k\leftarrow k-1\\\\
&amp; = H_n + \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{1}{k}\\\\
&amp; = H_n + H_{n+1} - 1\\\\
&amp; = H_h + H_n + \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{n+1}{n+1}\\\\
&amp; = 2H_n - \frac{n}{n+1}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h4>Sum by parts</h4>

<p>Using</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\Delta v &amp; = \frac{1}{k(k+1)} = (k-1)^{\underline{-2}}\\\\
v &amp; = -(k-1)^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
Ev &amp; = -k^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
u &amp; = 2k+1\\\\
\Delta u &amp; = 2\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>First the sum by part</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum \frac{2x+1}{x(x+1)}\delta x &amp; = 
-(2x+1)(x-1)^{\underline{-1}} + 2 \sum x^{\underline{-1}} \delta x + c\\\\
&amp; = -\frac{2x+1}{x} + 2 H_x + c\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Then the evaluation</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{2k+1}{k(k+1)} &amp; = \left. -\frac{2x+1}{x}+2H_x\right|_1^{n+1}\\\\
&amp; = -\frac{2(n+1)+1}{n+1} + 2 H_{n+1} + 2 + 1 - 2\\\\
&amp; = 2 H_{n+1} + 1 - 2 - \frac{1}{n+1}\\\\
&amp; = H_{n+1} + H_n - 1\\\\
&amp; = 2H_n - \frac{n}{n+1}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>$\sum_{1\le k \lt n}\frac{H_k}{(k+1)(k+2)}$</h3>

<p>For the sum by part, I use</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\Delta v &amp; = x^{\underline{-2}}\\\\
v &amp; = -x^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
Ev &amp; = -(x+1)^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
u &amp; = H_x\\\\
\Delta u &amp; = x^{\underline{-1}}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The sum by part</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n H_x x^{\underline{-2}} \delta x
&amp; = -H_x x^{\underline{-1}} + \sum
(x+1)^{\underline{-1}}x^{\underline{-1}}\delta x + c\\\\
&amp; = -H_x x^{\underline{-1}} + \sum x^{\underline{-2}} \delta x + c\\\\
&amp; = -H_x x^{\underline{-1}} - x^{\underline{-1}} + c\\\\
&amp; = -(H_x + 1) x^{\underline{-1}} + c\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The evaluation is</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{0\le k \lt n} \frac{H_k}{(k+1)(k+2)} &amp; =
\left. -\frac{H_x + 1}{x+1} \right|_0^n\\\\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{H_n + 1}{n+1}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>Product laws</h3>

<p>I don't think I listed all the laws for this exercise, as the only
complete list for the sum laws in the book is in the answer for this
exercise.</p>

<p>I will not repeat it here; suffice to say that when we replace sum by
product, the laws can be updated by replacing product by
exponentiation, and sum by product.</p>

<h3>$\prod_{1\le j \le k \le n}a_ja_k$</h3>

<p>While it took me a few false starts, I eventually found that the
triangular completion used for (2.32) works here as well.</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\left(\prod_{1\le j\le k \le n} a_ja_k \right)^2 &amp; = 
\left(\prod_{1\le j,k \le n}a_ja_k \right)
\left(\prod_{1\le j=k \le n}a_ja_k\right)\\\\
&amp; = \left(\prod_{1\le j,k \le n} a_j\right)
\left(\prod_{1\le j,k \le n} a_k\right)
\left(\prod_{1\le k \le n}a_k^2\right)\\\\
&amp; = \left(\prod_{1\le k \le n} a_k^n\right)
\left(\prod_{1\le j \le n} a_j^n\right)
\left(\prod_{1\le k \le n}a_k^2\right)\\\\
&amp; = \prod_{1\le k\le} a_k^{2n+2}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>So
$\prod_{1\le j \le k \le n}a_ja_k = \left(\prod_{1\le k\le} a_k\right)^{n+1}$.</p>

<h3>$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-2)^{\underline k}}{k}$</h3>

<p>As suggested, I worked out $\Delta c^{\underline x}$:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\Delta c^{\underline x} &amp; = c^{\underline{x+1}} - c^{\underline x}\\\\
&amp; = c(c-1)\cdots (c-x+1)(c-x) - c(c-1)\cdots (c-x+1)\\\\
&amp; = c^{\underline x}(c-x-1)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>I did not immediately saw the relation between this and the original
sum. First I rewrote the original sum to remove the division:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-2)^{\underline k}}{k}
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-2)^{\underline{k-1}}(-2-k+1)}{k}\\\\
&amp; = -\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-2)^{\underline{k-2}(k+1)(-2-k+2)}}{k}\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-2)^{\underline{k-2}(k+1)(k)}}{k}\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n (-2)^{\underline{k-2}}(k+1)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>Now the relation is visible. So we have</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\sum_1^{n+1}\frac{(-2)^{\underline x}}{x}\delta x &amp; = \sum_1^{n+1}(-2)^{\underline x}(x+1)\delta x\\\\
x &amp; = \left. - (-2)^{\underline{x-2}}\right|_1^{n+1}\\\\
&amp; = (-2)^{\underline{-1}} - (-2)^{\underline{n-1}}\\\\
&amp; = -1 - (-2)(-3) \cdots (-n)\\\\
&amp; = (-1)^n n! - 1\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h3>Incorrect derivation</h3>

<p>As stated in the book, the infinite sums do no converge, so the third
step is invalid.</p>

<p>And that's all for today.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-09T13:51:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.wakatta.jp/blog/2012/04/09/machine-learning-in-action-naive-bayes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am currently reading
<a href="http://www.manning.com/pharrington/">Machine Learning in Action</a>, as
I need something light between sessions with
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/gkp.html">Concrete Mathematics</a>. This
book introduces a number of important machine learning algorithms,
each time with a complete implementation and one or more test data sets; it also
explains the underlying mathematics, and provides information about
additional reference material (mostly heavier and more expensive books).</p>

<p>However, in Chapter 4 about Naïve Bayes classifiers, I didn't see how
the implementation derived by the maths. Eventually, I confirm that it
could not, and try to correct it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It is of course possible that the implementation is eventually
correct, and derives from more advanced theoretical concepts or
practical concerns, but the book mentions neither; on the other hands,
I found papers
(<a href="http://trevorstone.org/school/spamfiltering.pdf">here</a> or
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Etom/mlbook/NBayesLogReg.pdf">here</a>) that
seem to confirm my corrections.</p>

<p>Everything that follows assumes the book's implementation was
wrong. Humble and groveling apologies to the author if it was not.</p>

<h2>What exactly is the model</h2>

<p>The book introduces the concept of conditional probability using balls
in buckets. This makes the explanation clearer, but this is just one
possible model; each model (or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">distribution</a>)
uses dedicated formulas.</p>

<p>The problem is that the book then uses set of words or bags of words
as it these were the same underlying model, which they are not.</p>

<h3>Set of words</h3>

<p>If we are only interested in whether a given word is present in a
message or not, then the correct model is that of a biased coin where
tails indicate the absence of the word, and heads its presence.</p>

<p>This is also known as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial">Bernoulli trial</a>,
and the estimator for the probability of presence is the mean
presence: the number of documents in which the word is present,
divided by the total number of documents.</p>

<p>The book algorithm does not implement this model correctly, as its
numerator is the count of documents in which the word is present
(correct), but the denominator is the total number of words
(incorrect).</p>

<h3>Bag of words</h3>

<p>If we want to consider the number of times a word is present in
messages, then the balls in buckets model is correct (it is a
also known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution">Categorical distribution</a>),
and the code in the book adequately implements it.</p>

<h2>There is a word for it: Additive Smoothing</h2>

<p>The book then improves the algorithm in two different ways. One is the
use of logarithms to prevent underflow. The other is to always use one
as the basic count for words, whether they are present or not.</p>

<p>This is in fact not so much a trick as a concept called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing">Additive smoothing</a>,
where a basic estimator $\theta_i = \frac{w_i}{N}$ is replaced by
$\hat{\theta}_i = \frac{w_i + \alpha}{N + \alpha d}$</p>

<p>$\alpha$ is a so-called smoothing parameter, and $d$ is the total
number of words.</p>

<p>If the model is Bernoulli trial, $w_i$ is the number of documents
where word $i$ is present, and $N$ is the total number of documents.</p>

<p>If the model is categorical distribution, $w_i$ is the total count of
word $i$ is the documents and $N$ is the total count of words in the documents.</p>

<p>As we are interested in $P(w_i|C_j)$ (with $C_0, C_1$ the two
classes we are building a classifier for), $N$ above is restricted to
documents in the relevant class; $\alpha$ and $d$ are independent of
classes.</p>

<p>So the correct formula becomes</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
\hat{\theta}_{i,j} = \frac{x_i,j+\alpha}{N_j+\alpha d}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>With $\alpha=1$ as a smoothing parameter, the book should have used
<code>numWords</code> instead of <code>2.0</code> as an initial value for both <code>p0Denom</code> and
<code>p1Denom</code>.</p>

<h2>Putting it together</h2>

<p>The differences with the code from the book are minor: first I
introduce a flag to indicates whether I'm using set of words
(Bernoulli trials)  or bags of words (categorical distribution) as a
model. Then I initialise <code>p0Denom</code> and <code>p1Denom</code> with <code>numWords</code> as
explained above; finally I check the <code>bag</code> flag to know what to add to
either denominators.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>For the Spam test, the book version has an average error of 6%. The
rewritten version has an error between 3% and 4%. The Spam test uses
messages as set, for which my version is the most different.</p>

<p>For the New-York/San Francisco messages classification, I did not
measure any difference in error rates; this test uses messages as
bags, for which the book version was mostly correct (the only
difference was in the denominators).</p>

<h2>So what?</h2>

<p>OK, well, but the book algorithm still works, at least on the original
data.</p>

<p>But how well exactly would it work with other data? As the algorithm
does not seem to implement any kind of sound model, is there any way
to quantify the error we can expect? By building on theoretical
foundations, at least we can quantify the outcome, and rely on the
work of all the brilliant minds who improved that theory.</p>

<p>Theories (the scientific kind, not the hunch kind) provide well
studied abstractions. There are always cases where they do not apply,
and other cases where they do, but only partially or imperfectly. This
should be expected as abstractions ignore part of the real world
problem to make it tractable.</p>

<p>Using a specific theory to address a problem is very much similar to
looking for lost keys under a lamppost: maybe the keys are not there,
but that's where the light is brightest, so there is little chance to
find them anywhere else anyway.</p>

<h2>A bad book then?</h2>

<p>So far, this was the only chapter where I had anything bad to
say about the book. And even then, it was not that bad.</p>

<p>The rest of the book is very good; the underlying concepts are well
explained (indeed, that's how I found the problem in the first place),
there is always data to play with, and the choice of language and
libraries (<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">Numpy</a> and
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a>) is very well
suited to the kind of exploratory programming that makes learning
much easier.</p>

<p>So I would recommend this book as an introduction to this subject, and
I'm certainly glad I bought it.</p>

    <id>http://blog.wakatta.jp/blog/2012/03/15/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks-wrapping-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This has lasted a little bit longer than seven weeks (the release
schedule of the beta versions did not help; my day job did not help
either), but finally I finished the book.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Pro</h3>

<p>I liked that the book started with PostgreSQL. All too often, I am put
of by the amazingly uninformed criticisms of the NoSQL crowd about
relational databases; this left me with the general impression that a
younger generation of engineers was just too ignorant to figure SQL
out, so they build something new (without the benefits of decades of
experience...).</p>

<p>By having a balance approach, the book cleared this misconception
(<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010388.do">Hadoop, the Definitive Guide</a>
also has a balance coverage in its introduction).</p>

<p>Each database's strengths and weaknesses are correctly (as far as I
can tell) reported, along with its position in the CAP triangle, and
intended or ideal usage.</p>

<p>A recapitulative (but already partially incorrect, at least in the 5.0
beta version) overview of all the databases properties in Appendix A
is also very useful.</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>Well, this is not exactly a problem of the book itself, but rather of
the tools it covers: the rapid and sometimes radical changes in some
of the databases meant that the technical information in the book was
already obsolete.</p>

<p>The book's intention is not to be a detailed tutorial; for instance,
they skip installations (really, most technical books should skip
installation and go straight to setup and use; think of the number of
trees that would save), but the search for corrections was heavily
taxing my already sparse free time.</p>

<p>All this will eventually improve, as the tools and documentation
mature; right now using them is a bit too involved for the broad but
shallow approach this book follows.</p>

<p>Compared to
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>,
I found this book more challenging. But this is perhaps a consequence
of my prior exposure to a variety of languages and programming
concepts; I suspect many people may find this book much easier.</p>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<p>Of all the books I have read recently, this is the one that changed
and enlarged my views the most.</p>

<p>If you are, like me, a traditional software engineer with years of
experience in relational databases but little exposure to newer kind
of storage, you will benefit from this presentation of many databases and
solution designs.</p>

<p>If, however, you already come from the NoSQL database and have
experience in a few of the covered tools, this one book might not be
the ideal one to convince you of the strengths of PostgreSQL. The
problem with relational databases is that, having been the defacto
standard storage solutions for decades, nobody remember why they
became popular in the first place (they actually replaced databases
that looked pretty much like document or graph databases, only much
more primitive).</p>

<p>Still, given its price, as a broad introduction to many different
data tools and techniques, this book is hard to beat. I certainly am
glad for having read it, and I think you would be too.</p>
