    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The repertoire method is never really explained in the book, or
anywhere else I could find on the Internet. There are a couple of
posts on this subject, so I though I should add mine.</p>

<p>The repertoire method is really a tool to help with the intuitive step
of figuring out a closed formula for a recurrence equation. It does so
by breaking the original problem into smaller parts, with the hope
they might be easier to solve.</p>

<h3>Why it works</h3>

<p>Let's assume we have a system of recurrence equations with parameters,
so that the unknown function can be expressed as a linear combination
of other (unknown) functions where the coefficients are the parameters:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(1) &amp; = b(0, \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_m)\\\\
g(n) &amp; = r_n(g_1, \cdots, g_{n-1}, \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_m)\\\\
&amp; = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i(n)\alpha_i,
\end{align}
</div>


<p>We can consider $g$ as a specific point in a $m$-dimensional function
space (determined by both the recurrence equations, and the
parameters), and because $g$ is a linear combination, we can try to
find $m$ base functions (hopefully known or easy to compute)
$f_k(n) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i(n)\alpha_{i_k}$ with $1 \le k \le m$, expressed in
terms of $m$ linearly independent vectors
$(\alpha_{1_k},\cdots,\alpha_{m_k})$.</p>

<p>In other words, if we can find $m$ linearly independent parameter
vectors such that, for each, we have a known solution $f_k(n)$, then
we can express the function $g$ as a linear combination of $f_k(n)$
for any parameters (because the $m$ $f_k(n)$ form a base for the
$m$-dimensional function space defined by the recurrence equations).</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>First, we need to check that the recurrence equations accept a
solution expressed as</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(n) &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i(n)\alpha_i
\end{align}
</div>


<p>It is enough to plug this definition into the recurrence equations,
and make sure the different parameters always remain in different
terms.</p>

<p>Then we can either solve $f(n) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i(n)\alpha_i$ for
known $f(n)$, or for known $\alpha_i$
parameters, as long as we end up with $m$ linearly independent
parameter vectors (or, as it is equivalent, $m$ linearly independent
known functions for specific parameters).</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that a solution can be searched from
both direction: either set a function and try to solve for the
parameters, or set the parameters and solve for the function.</p>

<h3>Homework exercise</h3>

<p>Given</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(1) &amp; = \alpha\\\\
g(2n+j) &amp; = 3g(n) + \gamma n + \beta_j&amp;&amp;\text{for \(j=0, 1\) and \(n \gt 1 \)}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>We need to check that $g$ can be written as</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(n) &amp; = \alpha A(n) + \beta_0 B_0(n) + \beta_1 B_1(n) + \gamma C(n)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The base case is trivial. The recurrence case is</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(2n) &amp; = 3g(n) + \gamma n + \beta_0\\\\
&amp; = 3(\alpha A(n) +  \beta_0 B_0(n) + \beta_1 B_1(n) + \gamma C(n)) + \gamma n \beta_0\\\\
&amp; = \alpha 3A(n) + \beta_0 (3 B_0(n) + 1) + \beta_1 3B_1(n) + \gamma (3C(n) + n)\\\\
g(2n+1) &amp; = 3g(n) + \gamma n + \beta_1\\\\
&amp; = 3(\alpha A(n) +  \beta_0 B_0(n) + \beta_1 B_1(n) + \gamma C(n)) + + \gamma n\beta_1\\\\
&amp; = \alpha 3A(n) + \beta_0 3 B_0(n)+ \beta_1 (3B_1(n) + 1) + \gamma (3C(n) + n)\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>so $g$ can be expressed as a linear combination of other functions,
with the parameters as the coefficients.</p>

<p>Now, when I tried to solve this problem, I didn't know I could set the
parameters to values that would lead to an easy solution ($\gamma = 0$
turns the problem into an easy to solve generalised radix-based
Josephus problem); instead I wasted a lot of time trying to find known
functions and solve for the parameters, which is why I have four steps
below instead of just two as in the book.</p>

<h4>$g(n) = n$</h4>

<p>As the book suggests, I tried to solve for $g(n) = n$:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
1 = g(1) &amp; = \alpha&amp;&amp;\alpha = 1\\\\
2n = g(2n) &amp; = 3g(n) + \gamma n + \beta_0\\\\
&amp; = 3n + \gamma n + \beta_0&amp;&amp;\gamma = -1, \beta_0 = 0\\\\
2n+1 = g(2n+1) &amp; = 3g(n) + \gamma n + \beta_1\\\\
&amp; = 3n - n + \beta_1&amp;&amp; \beta_1 = 1\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h4>$g(2^m+l) = 3^m$</h4>

<p>As the recurrence equation looks like the generalised radix-based
Josephus equation, I tried to solve for $g(2^m+1) = 3^m$:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
1 = g(1) &amp; = \alpha&amp;&amp;\alpha = 1\\\\
3^m = g(2^m+2l) &amp; = 3g(2^{m-1}+l) + \gamma (2^{m-1} + l) + \beta_0\\\\
&amp; = 3\cdot 3^{m-1} + \gamma (2^{m-1} + l) + \beta_0&amp;&amp; \beta_0, \gamma = 0\\\\
3^m = g(2^m+2l+1) &amp; = 3g(2^{m^1}+l) + \gamma (2^{m-1} + l) + \beta_1\\\\
&amp; = 3\cdot 3^{m-1}&amp;&amp;\beta_1 = 0\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h4>$g(n) = 1$</h4>

<p>I tried to solve for $g(n) = 1$, as it seemed useful to solve for a
constant (no linear combination of linearly independent non-constant
functions can produce a constant function).</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
1 = g(1) &amp; = \alpha&amp;&amp; \alpha = 1\\\\
1 = g(2n+j) &amp; = 3g(n) + \gamma n + \beta_j\\\\
&amp; = 3 + \gamma n + \beta_j&amp;&amp; \gamma = 0, \beta_j = -2\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<h4>$\alpha, \beta_1 = 1, \beta_0,  \gamma = 0$</h4>

<p>This is the step that took me the longest, and when I finally
understood I could fix the parameters, I was able to use the
radix-based Josephus solution.</p>

<p>The recurrence equations</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(1) &amp; = 1\\\\
g(2n) &amp; = 3g(n)\\\\
g(2n+1) &amp; = 3g(n) + 1\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>have as solution $g(2^m + (b_m\cdots b_0)) = 3^m + (b_m\cdots b_0)_3$.</p>

<h4>Solving for $g(n)$</h4>

<p>We have the equations</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
A(n) - C(n) &amp; = n\\\\
A(2^m + l) &amp; = 3^m\\\\
A(n) -2(B_0(n) + B_1(n)) &amp; = 1\\\\
B_1(2^m+l) &amp; = h_3(l)&amp;&amp;\text{where \(h_3(b_m\cdots b_0) = (b_m\cdots b_0)_3\)}\\\\
\end{align}
</div>


<p>We have two functions already defined ($A(n)$ and $B_1(n)$), and the
other two equations give us the remaining function.</p>

<p>Now we can solve for $g(n)$:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(2^m+l) = \alpha 3^m &amp; + \beta_0 (\frac{3^m - 1}{2} - h_3(l))\\\\
&amp; + \beta_1 h_3(l) \\\\
&amp;+ \gamma (3^m + h_3(l) - 2^m - l)
\end{align}
</div>


<p>The $\gamma$ term is really $h_3(n) - n$.</p>

<p>The $\beta_0$ term is the same as $h_3(2^m-1-l)$, as can be seen by
observing that in base $3$, $3^m$ is $1$ followed by $m$ zeroes, so
$3^m-1$ is $m$ twos, and $\frac{3^m-1}{2}$ is $m$ ones, in other words
the same representation as the binary representation of $2^m-1$.</p>

<p>Now, the binary representation of $l$ is the same as the
representation in base $3$ of $h_3(l)$ (by definition of $h_3$), so
the binary representation of $2^m-1-l$ is the same as the
representation in base $3$ of $\frac{3^m-1}{2} - h_3(l)$.</p>

<p>With these two observations, it is possible to rewrite $g$ as</p>

<div markdown="0">
\begin{align}
g(1b_m\cdots b_0) &amp; = (\alpha\beta_{b_m}\cdots\beta_{b_0})_3 + \gamma ((1b_m\cdots b_0)_3 - (1b_m\cdots b_0)_2)
\end{align}
</div>


<p>which is the book solution.</p>

<h3>Faster solution</h3>

<p>It is enough to solve for
$\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1 \ne 0, \gamma = 0$,
and to find the parameters for $g(n) = n$. The first gives $A$,
$B_0$ and $B_1$ directly by the generalised radix-based Josephus
solution, and the second one adds a constraint to solve for $C$ as well.</p>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>

<p>As can be seen above, approaching the problem from both directions
(solving for known functions and solving for known parameters) can
result in time saved, and simplified expression of the solution.</p>
