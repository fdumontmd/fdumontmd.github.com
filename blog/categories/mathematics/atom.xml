    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the first post of this hopefully long series, I have a few notes I
wrote down as I was reading Chapter 1. Nothing revolutionary, but it
gives me a chance to play with math notation.</p>

<h1>Lines in the Plane</h1>

<p>I must admit that my memories of Geometry are far, far away (the
subject was not addressed at all when I studied Mathematics at
university, and I had no need for Geometry in my work since), so I
spent perhaps an unreasonable amount of time to check the validity of
the most elementary steps.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the exercises of a Geometric nature are
particularly challenging (as if I needed the extra difficulty).</p>

<h2>Intersecting lines</h2>

<p>The notion that one line will add $k$ new regions if it intersects
other lines at $k-1$ points is due to the fact that $k-1$ distinct
lines define at least $k$ regions (more if they are not all parallel),
and one more line that intersects them all will divide these $k$
regions in two.</p>

<h1>Josephus Problem</h1>

<h2>$J(5 \cdot 2^m) = 2^{m+1} + 1$</h2>

<p>This is based on the fact that $J(10) = 5$ and $J(2n) = 2J(n) -1$.</p>

<p>By induction:</p>

<p><em>Base case</em>: it is true for $m = 1$: $J(5\cdot 2) = J(10) = 5 =
2^{1+1} + 1$</p>

<p><em>Recurrence</em>: assuming it is true for $m$,</p>

<div markdown="0">
$$
\begin{align}
J(5\cdot 2^{m+1}) &amp;= J(2(5\cdot 2^m))\\\\
&amp;= 2J(5\cdot 2^m) - 1&amp;&amp;\text{as $J(2n) = 2J(n) -1$}\\\\
&amp;= 2(2^{m+1}+1) - 1&amp;&amp;\text{induction hypothesis}\\\\
&amp;= 2\cdot 2^{m+1} + 2 - 1\\\\
&amp;= 2^{m+2} + 1
\end{align}
$$
</div>


<h2>$A(2^{m}+l) = 2^{m}$</h2>

<p>It took me a while to convince myself that the $l$ was not a problem
here. This can be seen by considering $l$ in binary notation, and
using $A(2n) = 2A(n)$ and $A(2n+1) = 2A(n)$ to remove the rightmost
bit.</p>

<p>That is, with $2^m > l = (b_{m-1}b_{m-2}\cdots b_{1}b_{0})_2$,we have:</p>

<div markdown="0">
$$
\begin{align}
A(2^{m}+l) &amp;= A(2^{m}+(b_{m-1}b_{m-2}\cdots b_{1}b_{0})_2)\\\\
&amp;= 2A(2^{m-1}+(b_{m-1}b_{m-2}\cdots b_{1})_2)\\\\
&amp;= 2^{2}A(2^{m-2}+(b_{m-1}b_{m-2}\cdots b_{2})_2)\\\\
&amp;= 2^{3}A(2^{m-3}+(b_{m-1}b_{m-2}\cdots b_{3})_2)\\\\
&amp;= \cdots
\end{align}
$$
</div>


<p>At each iteration, whether $b_i$ is $0$ or $1$, we can ignore it when
dividing by $2$. And as $2^m &lt; l$, it takes no more than $m$ steps
(removing the $m$ bits $b_0$ to $b_{m-1}$) to reduce $A(2^m+l)$ to
$2^mA(1) = 2^m$</p>

<h2>Radix-based Generalised Josephus Solution</h2>

<p>The equation 1.18:</p>

<p>$$f \left( ( b_m b_{m-1} \cdots b_1 b_0)_d \right) = \left( \alpha_{b_m} \beta_{b_{m-1}} \beta_{b_{m-2}} \cdots \beta_{b_1} \beta_{b_0} \right)_c$$</p>

<p>is so unnaturally smart and simple that I thought the proof must be
missing. But in fact it is indeed trivial, and just as the book
states, follows from the rewriting of the argument in base $d$, then
recurrence over $m$ (with $m$ the number of digits or the argument in
base $d$).</p>

<p>In the next post in this series, I will start the exercises.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hawking once said that his editor had warned him that each
equation in his book would halve the readership.</p>

<p>With that in mind, and taking into account the number of readers of
this blog (or lack thereof), would I dare put any equations?</p>

<p>You better believe it!</p>

<p>I just picked up my old copy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics">Concrete Mathematics</a>,
a book I have too long neglected. The ultimate goal, of course, is
slaying the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">Beast</a>,
which I should try to complete before Donald E. Knuth passes away.
While I wish him a very long life, long enough at least to complete
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming#Volumes">Volume 5</a>,
and better yet 6 and 7, I should not take his remarkable health as an
excuse to dither.</p>

<p>For the math notation, I use <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a
JavaScript library that can parse either
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathMl</a>, or much better
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (which is based on
<a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/TeX.html">TeX</a>, another gift of Donald
E. Knuth to the world).</p>

<p>The setup for this blog is based on this
<a href="http://greglus.com/blog/2011/11/29/integrate-MathJax-LaTeX-and-MathML-Markup-in-Octopress/">post</a>.</p>

<p>The quality of rendering is variable: pretty good in Firefox, OK in
Safari or Chrome, and no idea in IE or Opera. Of course, it is not as
good as the output of LaTeX, but for the Web it is acceptable.</p>

<p>For instance, given the recurrence</p>

<div markdown="0">
$$
\begin{align}
f(j) &amp; = \alpha_j, &amp;&amp;\text{for $1 \\leq j \\lt  d$}\\\\
f(dn + j) &amp; = cf(n) + \beta_j, &amp;&amp;\text{for $0 \\leq j \\lt d$ and $n \\geq 1$}
\end{align}
$$
</div>


<p>then the solution is</p>

<p>$$f \left( ( b_m b_{m-1} \cdots b_1 b_0)_d \right) = \left( \alpha_{b_m} \beta_{b_{m-1}} \beta_{b_{m-2}} \cdots \beta_{b_1} \beta_{b_0} \right)_c$$</p>

<p>(refer to the book for explanations).</p>

<p>Isn't this lovely?</p>
