[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks), by Bruce Tate, is an interesting take on the concept of language tutorial.
<!--more-->
A language tutorial is, by its nature, limited it what it can cover. But languages are not isolated, and comparing several of them, even superficially, can highlight family traits, or put in contrast fundamental design choices.

This is the approach chosen by Bruce Tate in his Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: to introduce seven languages, each one in three days (leaving 4 days of rest, or perhaps work), and to rely on previous knowledge to clarify new concepts.

So for the next few weeks, I will be blogging through this book.
