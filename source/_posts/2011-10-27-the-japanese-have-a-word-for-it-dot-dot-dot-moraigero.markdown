Words are born in and reflect a culture. What kind of culture could craft a word such as moraigero?
<!--more-->
Basically, the word is Japanese. It combines morau ([ 貰う](http://jisho.org/words?jap=%E8%B2%B0%E3%81%86&eng=&dict=edict)), which means "to receive", and gero ([げろ](http://jisho.org/words?jap=%E3%81%92%E3%82%8D&eng=&dict=edict)), which means "spew".

But what on earth were they thinking when they combined these two words?

The meaning is what happens when a number of fairly drunk people are stuck together in a closed area, such as (usually) a train, one of the get ... sick, and the others start to get similarly ... sick, in turn. They "receive" the "spew".

It is bad enough that such a situation could happen; but worse is that it is so common they need a word for it...
