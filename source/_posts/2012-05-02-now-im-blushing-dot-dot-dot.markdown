Eric Redmond, one of the authors of
[Seven Databases in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks)
apparently found my blog, read it and posted a nice comment on
[his blog](http://sevenweeks.org/).

Now I have no choice but to urge all my three readers (that includes
you, Mom) to go and buy this great book. Even if you already own a
copy.
