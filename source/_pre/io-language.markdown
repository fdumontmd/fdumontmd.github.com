The least I can say, is that [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/) is interesting, but in the sense and to the extent that [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is interesting.

The name seems to have been selected to make Google useless. Not that there is any Io related content to find, anyway.

As I was reading [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks]({{ root_url }}/books/7languages7weeks), I could see why I might want to use each of the proposed languages, except for Io.

To be fair, I do not have any experience with nor use for embedded languages; moreover the platform I use the most is the JVM (which has its own embedded languages). But it feels like Io embraces minimalism as an end in itself, rather than a cure to other problems.
