"Wakatta!" is Japanese for "I get it!". This is not really a blog about Japanese; it is about computer science, mathematics and science in general.

About me
--------

I am a software engineer, working and living in Tokyo, Japan. To clear my mind of my daily chores, I enjoy learning new things, and this blog documents my struggles doing so.

Before you ask, my Japanese is not good, just enough to laugh whenever I hear "ブラじゃないよ！".
